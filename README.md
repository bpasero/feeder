# Feed Reader

A local-first RSS / Atom / JSON Feed reader. Node + SQLite on the server, Vite + React on the client. Includes a Reader Mode that fetches the source article and runs Mozilla Readability for clean, distraction-free reading.

## Quick start

```bash
npm run install:all   # installs root, server, and client deps
npm run dev           # starts both processes via concurrently
```

Open <http://localhost:5173>. The server runs on port 3001.

On the very first launch (empty database) the server seeds six default feeds:

- Hacker News — `https://hnrss.org/frontpage`
- Lobste.rs — `https://lobste.rs/rss`
- The Verge — `https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml`
- Ars Technica — `https://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index`
- Daring Fireball — `https://daringfireball.net/feeds/main`
- BBC News (Technology) — `https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/technology/rss.xml`

Subsequent restarts do not re-seed. To reset and re-seed, delete the SQLite files:

```bash
rm server/data.db server/data.db-shm server/data.db-wal
```

## Features

- Subscribe to any **RSS**, **Atom**, or **JSON Feed** URL.
- **Three-column layout:** feed sidebar / item list / reader pane. The reader pane is togglable via the top-right panel icon and the preference is persisted to `localStorage`.
- **Collapsible sidebar:** the top-left panel icon collapses the feed sidebar to a thin rail of avatars (unread feeds get an accent dot). Hovering or keyboard-focusing the rail expands the full sidebar as an overlay above the item list so you can pick another feed, then collapses back when you move away. Opening the inline "+" add-feed form keeps the sidebar expanded until you submit or cancel. Preference is persisted as `sidebarCollapsed`.
- **Add-feed in the sidebar:** a compact `+` button in the sidebar header expands an inline URL input — no chrome at the top of the app. Esc cancels.
- **Reader Mode:** clicking an item triggers a background fetch of the source URL on the server, which runs `@mozilla/readability` over the parsed DOM and returns clean extracted content (title, byline, body). Results are cached per item in a `reader_articles` table.
- **Reader / Original toggle:** segmented control in the reader header. *Reader* shows the extracted article; *Original* renders the source page in a sandboxed iframe (`allow-scripts allow-popups allow-forms`, `no-referrer`). Choice is persisted as `showOriginal`. Sites that refuse to embed via `X-Frame-Options` / `frame-ancestors` can still be opened in a new tab with **Open original**.
- **Tabs:** each opened article becomes a tab in the reader pane. Middle-click closes a tab; the close (×) button shows on hover. Tabs survive switching feeds because each tab holds its own snapshot.
- **Drag and drop:**
  - Drag a tab in the strip to reorder it (dragged tab fades; drop target gets an accent indicator).
  - Toggle **Grid view** (shown when ≥2 tabs are open, persisted as `gridMode`) to render every open tab as a tile in a CSS auto-fit grid (`minmax(300px, 1fr)`). Drag a tile by its header to reorder. The active tile gets an accent border; the reader-pane actions (mark read, open original, reader/original) apply to it.
- **Light + dark theme** via `prefers-color-scheme` — no toggle required, OKLCH color tokens flip automatically.
- Per-feed unread counts, item read/unread state, bulk "Mark all read".
- Manual refresh per feed or all at once.
- **Context menus** (right-click) on every row:
  - **All feeds:** Refresh all · Mark everything as read.
  - **A feed:** Refresh · Mark all as read · Copy feed URL · Open homepage · Unsubscribe.
  - **An item:** Mark as read/unread · Open original · Copy article URL.

## Security

Defenses live in `server/src/feeds.ts` and `server/src/index.ts`:

- **SSRF:** scheme allowlist (http/https only), DNS-resolved private/loopback/link-local IP block, redirect cap of 5 with re-validation per hop.
- **CSRF:** middleware rejects state-changing requests when `Origin` is present and not on localhost.
- **XSS:** all feed and reader content sanitized via DOMPurify before rendering.
- **Fetch timeout:** every outbound HTTP call uses `AbortSignal.timeout(15000)`.
- **Input validation:** `limit` query param clamped 1…500, `mark-all-read` rejects invalid `feedId`.

## Scripts

| Command                | What it does                                |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run install:all`  | Install root, server, and client deps       |
| `npm run dev`          | Run server (3001) + client (5173) together  |
| `npm run dev:server`   | Run only the server                         |
| `npm run dev:client`   | Run only the client                         |
| `npm run build`        | Production build of the client              |

## API

All endpoints are mounted under `/api`. State-changing endpoints (POST/PATCH/DELETE) require either no `Origin` header or one on `localhost`.
